If you purchase our ‘Genotyping Services,’ we will send you a kit for collecting and sending to us a sample of your pet’s saliva. We will analyze the DNA in that sample to provide you with your pet’s Genetic Information, through our Site and/or Apps. The state of the art of the genetic research and technology that we use will change, and potentially improve, over time. If the state of the art improves, you may wish to obtain further Services from us in order to obtain a more complete understanding of your pet’s Genetic Information. No samples that you send to us will be returned to you.</p></li><li><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 MuiTypography-paragraph css-mdpl1k">Kits may contain a stated expiration date. Any kit that does not contain a stated expiration date expires 12 months following the date it the kit was shipped to you. These expiration periods may only be extended if required by appliable law, in which case the kits expire on the first date legally permitted. Embark has no obligation to provide Genotyping Services with respect to any sample that was received by Embark after your Kit’s expiration date (an “Expired Sample”). If Embark chooses to provide Genotyping Services on an Expired Sample, you may first be required to pay an additional fee, provide a new sample at additional cost, or repurchase Embark’s Genotyping Services at Embark’s sole discretion. No additional fees or costs will be charged without your separate consent, but such consent may be required before Embark provides Genotyping Services. Embark is not obligated to process samples or otherwise provide Genotyping Services collected from expired kits or collected without the use of the provided Embark Kit. Expired Kits and Expired Samples will have no currency or exchange value, and will not be transferable or refundable.
